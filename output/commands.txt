Sure, here are the commands you need to execute in the command line:

1. Create a new directory for the project:
```bash
mkdir new_test_framework
```
2. Navigate into the new directory:
```bash
cd new_test_framework
```
3. Initialize a new Node.js project:
```bash
npm init -y
```
This will create a new `package.json` file in your project directory. The `-y` flag will set the default configuration.

4. Install dependencies needed. For this project, we will need Playwright:
```bash
npm install --save playwright
```
This will install Playwright and save it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

5. Create the necessary folders for the new framework structure. Let's assume you want a similar structure to the legacy framework:
```bash
mkdir -p tests pages utils resources/testdata
```
This will create the `tests`, `pages`, `utils` directories at the root of your project, and `testdata` directory inside `resources`.

6. You can also create the necessary files like `.gitignore`, `README.md` etc. using the `touch` command:
```bash
touch .gitignore README.md
```
This will create the `.gitignore` and `README.md` files in your project directory.

Remember to replace `new_test_framework` with the actual name of your project and the dependencies with the actual dependencies you need.
